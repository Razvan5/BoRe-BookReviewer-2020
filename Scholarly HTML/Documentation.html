        <section id="userAccount">
            <h3>User Account</h3>
            <p> Book Wormhole allows the user to create an account and log in. An account is necessary to use the
                website.
                The user can also edit his account information at any given time.
            </p>
        </section>


        <section id="bookManagement">
            <h3>Book Management</h3>
            <p> Book Wormhole allows its users to search for books by title, author, or genre. Also it provides the user
                with recommendations:
                high rated books of a certain category (genre).
            </p>

            <p> Users are provided information about the books, which includes: title, author, rating, genre(s), number
                of pages, publisher, edition, etc.
                Also they can view a list of reviews given by other users.
            </p>

            <p>
                The user may save books in his/her own library (the "myBooks" page) and remove them, if he/she sees fit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the user has added a book, they may rate it and give details about their progress ("Want to read",
                "At page 200", "Finished", etc). The user can also write a review of the book.
            </p>

        <section id="friends">
            <h3>Friends</h3>
            <p>
                A user can search for other users to view their book library and activity.
                If a user is interested in the activity of other users, he/she can save them in the frinds list.
                The friends list allows a user to quickly access other users, without needing to do a search every time.
            </p>
        </section>


        <section id="groups">
            <h3>Groups</h3>
            <p>
                Every user can create or join a group.
                Groups are the perfect environment for users to share their reading experience. Every member of a group
                can suggest books for the group to read/discuss, but only the group owner/admins may
                add a suggested book to the group's activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Groups can also be used for educational purposes: a teacher may create a group for their class, add
                books and monitor the students' reading activity.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="statistics">
            <h3>Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                The website provides its users with statistics about their reading activity. Statistics can be exported
                in three formats: minimal, CSV and DocBook.

            <h3>Groups</h3>
            <p>
                Every user can create or join a group.
                Groups are the perfect environment for users to share their reading experience. Every member of a group
                can suggest books for the group to read/discuss, but only the group owner/admins may

                Groups can also be used for educational purposes: a teacher may create a group for their class, add
                books and monitor the students' reading activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                To search for groups or view the groups you're a part of, go to the "Community" page by clicking the "Community" button located at the top of most webpages.
                Alternatively, you can type localhost:3000/comunity in your web browser.
                To searh for a group, put the cursor over the magnifying glass and type the group's name, then press Enter. A list of matching groups will appear below.
                Clicking on any group's picture will send you to that group's page, where you can view its mebers and activity and also join the group.
            </p>
            <p> Now, back to the community page, you have the option to create your own group by clicking the "Create Group" button. Once the group is created, you can edit it, by clicking on the 
                "Edit Group" button (it resembles a purple pencil inside a square). This will take you to the "Group-edit" page, but only if you are the creator, or an administrator. Editing your group info works similarly
                with editing your user info.

        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <section id="componentsAndResources">
            <h3>Components and Resources</h3>
            <p> BookWormhole is divided into three components: The Web Application, the API and the Database.</p>
            <section id="theWebAPP">
                <h4>The Web Application</h4>
                <p>The web application contains two components: the client side and the server.</p>
                <p>The client consists of a series of 20+ webpages written in HTML5 and styled using CSS. We have opted to use the JavaScript programming language in order to implement the functionality of the pages.</p>
                <p>The client side communicates with the server by sending Ajax requests. </p>
                <p> The BookWormhole server uses Node.js, a runtime environment also based on JavaScript.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="theDataBase">
                <h4>The Data Base</h4>
                    <p>The Data Base was created using SqLite and the SqLite browser: https://sqlitebrowser.org/. Its purpose is to store information regarding BookWormhole's users, groups and books.</p>
                    <p>The Data Base contains eight tables. Here is a schema of their structure and relations: </p>
                    <img src="images/SchemaBD.png">
            </section>
            <section id="theAPI">
                <h4>The API</h4>
                <p>The API is a component which processes the requests received by the server. The API browses the database and extracts information, then processes it and offers it to the server, which in turn will send it back to
                    the client side (the webpage that made the request, to be more precise).
                </p>
                <p>We have opted to use the Goodreads API for our project : https://www.goodreads.com/api</p>
                <p>The Goodreads API is free to use for software developers with a developer key.</p>
                <p>The reason for this choice is that Goodreads is a website with similar functions to BookWormhole so it helps us process many of the server requests without needing to implement everything from scratch.</p>
                <p>Limitations: the Goodreads API only allows one request per second. It will provide you with data from the goodreads website, but that data will only remain on our site for a maximum of 24 hours.</p>
                <p>BookWormhole is a student project built for education purposes, so the request limit is not a significant disadvantage. Moreover, since we have our own database, the 24h limit does not apply.</p>

        <section id="behaviour">
            <h3>Project Behaviour</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The client uses the web browser to access BookWormhole and its features.</li>
                <li>The browser sends sends a request to the server for a certain webpage.</li>
                <li>The server checks the html files in the client-side, opens the requested file and sends it as a 'Content-Type': 'text/html' stream to the browser.</li>
                <li>In other words, the client uses the client-side part of the web Application through the server.</li>
                <li>When the client makes modifications, such as searching for a book, or changing his account information, the client-side sends an Ajax request to the server wich contains information.</li>
                <li>The server receives that information and sends it to the API, which analyzes it and executes certain actions involving the Data Base.</li>
                <li>The API queries the database, extracts and processes information which the server then sends back to the client-side.</li>
                <li>Some requests, such as removing or adding a book lead to modifying the contents of the database.</li>
                <li>The client-side processes that information and modifies the webpages accordingly, providing the client with content.</li>
            </ul>
